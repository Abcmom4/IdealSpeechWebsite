I currently accept private pay only at this time. Most insurance plans cover some variation of speech therapy, depending on the client's diagnosis. In-home therapy and teletherapy sessions are usually covered the same as therapy provided in a clinic or hospital setting. Clients are provided with a detailed invoice for each session that includes all information necessary to submit to insurance for reimbursement.
