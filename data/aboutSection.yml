  ### Providing comprehensive speech and language services for children in the Boston area for over 20 years

  I obtained my Bachelors of Science in Speech and Hearing Sciences from the University of Arizona and my Masters of Science in Communication Disorders from Boston University. 
  Since then I have worked in a variety of settings including early intervention, pre-school, public schools and private practice.
  I am state licensed and nationally certified in the field of speech-language pathology. 
  I have extensive experience providing fun, evidenced-based speech language therapy services and a passion for working with children and their caregivers to provide ideal outcomes for each individual.
