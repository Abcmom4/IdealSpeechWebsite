Most insurance plans cover some variation of speech therapy, depending on the client&amp;rsquo;s diagnosis. In-home therapy and teletherapy sessions are usually covered the same as therapy provided in a clinic or hospital setting. Clients are provided with a detailed invoice for each session that includes all information necessary to submit to insurance for reimbursement.</description></item></channel></rss>
